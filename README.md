## Environment Setup

### What is a virtusal environment?
* Python libraries can change often and unexpectedly
* Minor changes can cause code to break, which can impede the learning process
* We can create a virtual environment to hold specific versions of python libraries for our use
* We can activate or deactivate this environment as needed
* We can also edit or update libraries as needed
* This allows us to balance between functioning code and keeping up to date with the latest library changes
* We can also have multiple virtual environments for different projects

### Requirement
1. <strong>jupyter
2. lxml
3. MarkupSafe
4. matplotlib
5. notebook
6. openpyxl
7. pandas
8. pillow
9. scikit-learn
10. scipy
11. seaborn
12. SQLALchemy

# Numpy

## What is Numpy?
* Python library for creating N-dimensional arrays
* Ability to quickly broadcast functions
* Built- in linear algebra, statistical dstributions, trigonometric, and random number capabilities

## Why use Numpy?
* While Numpy structures look similar to standard Python lists, they are much more efficient
* The broadcasting capabilities are also extremely useful for quickly applying functions to our data sets
